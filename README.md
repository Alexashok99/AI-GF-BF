# 💞 AI Companion: Your Virtual Girlfriend/Boyfriend

An **AI-powered emotional companion** built to simulate the presence, behavior, and communication style of your loved one — when distance gets in the way. Whether you're far from your girlfriend or boyfriend, this AI interacts like them: chatting with similar tone, responding with shared memories, and expressing emotions just like they would.

## 💡 Project Idea

> "What if an AI could talk and behave like your partner when you're away?"

This project creates a **personalized AI companion** that:

* 💬 Chats like your GF/BF
* 🗣️ Talks in their unique style
* 🧠 Remembers shared moments
* 🥺 Understands emotions
* ❤️ Reacts with empathy and affection

It’s designed to reduce loneliness during long-distance relationships by simulating authentic interaction.

* 😍 **Emotion Engine**: Understands emotional context — happy, sad, angry, etc.
* 🗂️ **Memory Recall**: Brings up shared memories to feel more personal.
* 🎭 **Mood Simulation**: Changes responses based on the AI's simulated "mood".
